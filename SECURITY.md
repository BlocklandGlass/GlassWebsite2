## Reporting a vulnerability

To report vulnerabilities to us, please e-mail the Blockland Glass security mailing list via **security@blocklandglass.com**

We will send you a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, we will keep you informed of the progress towards remediation, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

**We ask you to not publicly disclose the vulnerability until it has been remediated, unless you have received a response from us that you can do so.**
